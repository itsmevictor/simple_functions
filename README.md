# simple_functions
Simple functions that are useful when working in R. 

If ever you are interested in some function, feel free to visit the `R/` folder and get the code you want. Also, in the unlikely case that you want to install the package, you can do so in the following way:

```
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("itsmevictor/simple_functions")
```
